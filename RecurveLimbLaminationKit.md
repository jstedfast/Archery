## Description

The Recurve Limb Lamination Kit saves you the hassle of trying to calculate the thickness of your bow limbs. We will do all the math for you. Just fill in the appropriate information from the drop down menus, and we'll get to work building your new bow limbs. You can choose from a wide variety of woods and several different colors of glass for your limbs, including clear glass, which allows you to see the wood on the back and belly of the bow.

In the Recurve Limb Lamination Kit you will have two separate layers of wood sandwiched between a layer of glass on the back and a layer of glass on the belly of the bow.

The parallel wood lamination is of uniform thickness. If you choose maple, red elm, action-boo, or ash for the parallel, it will come 72" long, the same length as the glass. If you choose any other wood, the parallel will come as a 36" matched pair.

The tapered wood lamination narrows in thickness at an .002" per running inch taper. The taper will always come as a matched 36" pair.
