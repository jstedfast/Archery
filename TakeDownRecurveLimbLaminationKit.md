## Description

The Bingham Project's Take-Down Recurve Limb Lamination Kit saves you from the hassle of worrying about your stack thickness. Just fill in the relevant information in the drop down boxes and we'll get started on your new bow limbs.

We have a wide variety of woods to choose from for your core laminations and wedges, and several different colors of glass that will go on the back and belly of the bow. If you wish to see the wood on the back and belly, choose the clear glass option.

In our Take-Down Recurve Limb Lamination Kit you will receive two pieces of wood, two pieces of glass, and a pair of wedges. The parallel piece of wood is of uniform thickness, and comes in a matched 36" pair. The tapered piece of wood gets smaller towards one end, tapering at an .002" per running inch taper. The taper also comes in a matched 36" pair. The wedges are a matched pair, and will be 8.25" long for 58"-62" bows, and 10.25" long for 64"-68" bows.

A Take-Down, or 3-piece bow has many advantages over a traditional one-piece bow, while retaining all of the same working characteristics. The ability to take the bow apart makes travel a breeze. And you can easily use the same riser for multiple sets of limbs, allowing you to fashion a set of limbs for the range, and a heavier poundage set of limbs for hunting, for example.

Please note that the riser is sold separately. Click here to go to the riser product page and pick out a wood for your riser.

To attach your limbs to the riser, you will need a limb locking hardware kit. The limb locking hardware comes in bezel or knob style, and the bezels come in black or brass.
