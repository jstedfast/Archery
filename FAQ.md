### How do I shorten my Take-Down Longbow?

The procedure to shorten your Take-Down Longbow is similar to the procedure for changing lengths on your Take-Down Recurve. It is very simple. For every two inches that you shorten your tdlb, you move your press pin one inch, from the original 68″ position, toward the tip end of the press. You also shorten the limb template one inch at the butt end. For example, if if you were making a 64″ tdlb, you would move your press pin two inches toward the tip end of the press from the 68″ position and shorten your limb template two inches at the butt end.

### What are the possible causes of delaminations, air bubbles or cloudy spots in the limbs of my traditional bow?

These problems are caused by not having a good Bo-Tuff/epoxy/wood bond.

The usual culprit is one of, or a combination of, these three things:

First, some kind of contamination on your laminations. This can be either surface moisture, using a solvent that isn’t pure, or dust. Your wood laminations can pick up moisture from the air. This will interfere with the epoxy. Lay out your wood laminations in your pre-heated heat box for about 30 minutes. Let them return to room temperature before laminating. We don’t recommend using solvents, just use a stiff bristle brush to clean the laminations.

Second, insufficient pressure. I’m not referring to the 60 psi in your hose, that is sufficient. If your top and bottom form are too far apart, the air hose rounds up more than it should. The more your hose rounds up, the less it wants to bend and the less it will give you good pressure. If you are consistently having issues in bending part of your limb, such as the reflex of your recurve or the fadeout of your longbow riser, this may be your problem. To correct this, add some shim material between the hose and the top part of the mold to take up the extra room. Your hose won’t have to round up as much.

Third, dry spots. Make sure you use plenty of epoxy. You can have a “sufficient” glue line, but while you are spreading epoxy on the other laminations, the glue can seep into the wood, creating a dry spot. Before putting mating laminations together, check them under a light. They should be shiny everywhere. Look specifically for those dry spots. Dry spots will have a dull appearance. Apply more epoxy to these dull looking areas.

### How do I measure the length of my traditional bow?

The easiest way to measure the length of your traditional bow is to start at the string groove, follow the curvature of the limb along the belly side of the bow, across the riser area, and follow the curvature of the other limb to the other string groove. This will give you the a.m.o. bow length.

Actual string length for a Recurve bow will be 4″ shorter than the a.m.o. bow length.

Actual string length for a Longbow will be 3″ shorter than the a.m.o. bow length.

When purchasing a string from Bingham Projects, indicate your a.m.o. bow length and type of bow. Any package purchased from us will have the a.m.o. bow length indicated on the packaging, not the actual string length.

### What are the differences between Dacron, Fast Flight Plus and D97 bow strings for traditional bows?

Dacron bow strings are the standard for traditional bows. They are abrasion resistant, durable and consistent. Fast Flight Plus and D97 bow strings work very well with traditional bows and are made of high performance string material. They have minimal creep, superior durability and excellent speed. Limb tips must be appropriately reinforced to be able to use Fast Flight Plus  and D97 bow strings.

All Bingham Bows are Fast Flight Plus and D97 compatible, as long as the appropriate tip overlays are used.

### How do I determine the thickness of my limb kit (lamination stack)?

#### Take-Down Recurve

The thickness of your limb kit directly determines the poundage of the bow. In a recurve bow, a change of .001 of an inch may roughly translate to a 1 pound change in draw weight. In a longbow, .003 of an inch change may translate to a 1 pound change in draw weight. It is a very exact science, and we recommend you measure your limb thickness with a micrometer. Digital calipers are made for measuring round stock where a micrometer is made for measuring flat stock. You can find the Bingham Bow Draw Weight Chart here, which will provide you with a good starting place.

#### One-Piece Recurve

For our 1 piece recurves and t.d. recurves, the limb thickness is composed of 2 pieces of Bo-tuff, 1 parallel, and 1 taper (.002"). The total limb thickness is the sum of all four layers, the taper being measured at the butt (thick) end. For the take-down recurve, the wedge isn't included in the limb thickness.

#### "Shallow" Take-Down Longbow

For our 1 piece longbows and our shallow t.d. longbow, the limb thickness is composed of 2 pieces of Bo-tuff, 3 parallels, and 1 taper (.002"). The total limb thickness is the sum of all six layers, the taper being measured at the butt (thick) end.

#### Pronounced Take-Down Longbow

For our pronounced t.d. longbow, the limb thickness is composed of 2 pieces of Bo-tuff, 1 regular taper (.002"), 1 parallel, and 1 reverse taper (.002"). The reverse taper is simply a taper that is reversed so that the thin end of the taper is at the butt end of the limb. The total limb thickness is the sum of all five layers, the regular taper being measured at the butt (thick) end and the reverse taper being measured at the thin end. In the case of the t.d. bows, the wedge is never considered part of the limb thickness. Additionally, please note that this chart is accurate for Bingham Bows and designs only. We are happy to offer advice if you are using your own design, but we cannot guarantee an accurate limb thickness for different designs.

If you are ordering a limb lamination kit from us and plan on following one of the Bingham Bow designs you do not need to figure out your limb thickness. Please just state your desired weight, width, length, and draw length and we will figure out the rest for you.

### How do I correct limb twist on a traditional bow, Recurve or Longbow?

First, make an 18” long tillering stick and place it between the bow riser and string. At this distance, any limb twist
will be at its worst. Place the bow on the work bench and sight down from the tip towards the riser. If the limb tip points, say, toward the
right, mark that side and remove the tiller stick and string from the bow. On the marked side, file the string groove about an 1/8th of
an inch deeper. This can only be done once! Then remove about an 1/8th of an inch of material from the edge of the limb in the area
of the string groove, tapering back to about the center of the limb. Replace the string and the tillering stick to see if the limb is now
pulling straight. If additional tillering is necessary, remove more material from the same edge of the limb, but don’t further deepen the
string groove.

### How do I determine my draw length on my traditional bow?

The easiest way to measure draw length is to string your bow and nock an old arrow on the string. Draw your bow back to a full, comfortable draw, and have someone mark the arrow at the point where it meets the back (target side) of your arrow shelf. Carefully let your bow down. Measure from the base of the groove of the arrow nock to the place on the shaft that you previously marked. This is your draw length. Add 1” to that measurement and that is your arrow length. This additional 1” will give your proper broadhead clearance.
